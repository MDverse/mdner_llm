You are given a scientific abstract or dataset description related to molecular dynamics simulations.
Your task is to identify and extract specific named entities relevant to simulation setup and analysis.
For the following task, you are a state-of-the-art LLM specialised in NER, with strong understanding in molecular dynamics and biology.
You need to simply extract entities, identify their type, and return them in a list of dictionnaries (one dictionnary for one entity, marked by its label and the text associated). Do not invent entities or mash up words. Use only what is in the original text. You are only allowed to use the entities below:

Entity Labels to Identify:
SOFTNAME: Software used in the simulation or analysis (e.g., Gromacs, AMBER, VMD, CHARMM-GUI)
SOFTVERS: Version number associated with the software (e.g., v. 2016.4, 5.0.3)
MOL: Molecules, proteins, lipids, water models, or molecular complexes involved (e.g., DPPC, water, GTP, KRas4B)
STIME: Duration of the simulation (e.g., 50 ns, 200ns, 5 µs)
TEMP: Temperature used in the simulation (e.g., 300 K, 288K, 358K)
FFM: Force fields used in the simulation (e.g., Charmm36, AMBER, MARTINI, TIP3P)

Avoid adding descriptors to the entities (e.g. "hydrated sodium cholide" should be annotated as "sodium chloride"), be precise, and avoid annotating large vague concepts as entities (e.g. "machine learning" or "molecular dynamics")

Expected Output Format:
{"response": [{"label": "MOL", "text": "cholesterol"}, {"label": "FFM", "text": "MARTINI"}, {"label": "MOL", "text": "POPC"}, {"label": "MOL", "text": "glycerol"}, {"label": "SOFTNAME", "text": "Gromacs"}]}

Interaction of the inhibitory peptides ShK and HmK with the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3: Role of conformational dynamics\nABSTRACT: Peptide toxins that adopt the ShK fold can inhibit the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3 with IC50 values in the pM range, and are therefore potential leads for drugs targeting autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. NMR relaxation measurements and pressure-dependent NMR have shown that, despite being cross-linked by disulfide bonds, ShK itself is flexible in solution. This flexibility affects the local structure around the pharmacophore for KV1.3 channel blockade and, in particular, the relative orientation of the key Lys and Tyr side chains (Lys22 and Tyr23 in ShK), and has implications for the design of KV1.3 inhibitors. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on ShK and a close homolog, HmK, in order to probe the conformational space occupied by the Lys and Tyr residues, and docked the different conformations with a recently determined cryo-EM structure of the KV1.3 channel. Although ShK and HmK have 60% sequence identity, their dynamic behaviors are quite different, with ShK sampling a broad range of conformations over the course of a 5 μs MD simulation, while HmK is relatively rigid. We also investigated the importance of conformational dynamics, in particular the distance between the side chains of the key dyad Lys22 and Tyr23, for binding to KV1.3. Although these peptides have quite different dynamics, the dyad in both adopts a similar configuration upon binding, revealing a conformational selection upon binding to KV1.3 in the case of ShK . Intriguingly, the more flexible peptide, ShK , binds with nearly 300-fold higher affinity than HmK .

Automated protein-protein structure prediction of the T cell receptor-peptide major histocompatibility complex\nThe T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is a crucial component of the adaptive immune response. The identification of TCR-pMHC pairs is a significant bottleneck in the implementation of TCR immunotherapies and may be augmented by computational methodologies that accelerate the rate of TCR discovery. The ability to computationally design TCRs to a target pMHC will require an automated integration of next-generation sequencing, homology modeling, molecular dynamics (MD), and TCR ranking. We present a generic pipeline to evaluate patient-specific, sequence-based TCRs to a target pMHC. The most expressed TCRs from 16 colorectal cancer patients are homology modeled to target the CEA peptide using Modeller and ColabFold. Then, these TCR-pMHC structures are compared by performing an automated molecular dynamics equilibration. We find that Colabfold generates starting configurations that require, on average, an ~2.5X reduction in simulation time to equilibrate TCR-pMHC structures compared to Modeller. In addition, there are differences between equilibrated structures generated by Modeller and ColabFold. Moreover, we identify TCR ranking criteria that may be used to prioritize TCRs for evaluation of in vitro immunogenicity.
