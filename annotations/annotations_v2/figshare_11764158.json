    "raw_text": "6 molecular dynamics simulations of coronavirus 2019-nCoV protease model in complex with different conformations of lopinavir.\nMolecular dynamics simulations of comparative model of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV protease Mpro in complex with 6 different conformations based on the Catalophore point-cloud alignment and (re)- docking of lopinavir into the 2019ncov virus protease model. The docking experiment produced 8 clusters of possible conformations, we chose 6 out of 8 conformers and ran an all-atom 300 ps MD at 310 K ( 36.85 C ).-The two images in the main folder refers to the docked structures before MD simulation.-The file all centroids.pse contains the frames representing the centroid of the subsequent MD simulation for each docking cluster.-Each archive contains the centroid in PDB format, the starting frame of the simulation in GRO format and the compressed trajectory in XTC format. In the directory \"other files\" there are other data generated during the simulation, i.e. heatmap representing the contact frequency between the ligand atoms and the ones belonging to the homology model.",
