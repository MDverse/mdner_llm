    "raw_text": "Large-scale motions of hGBP1\nGuanylate binding proteins (GBPs) belong to the dynamin-related superfamily and exhibit various functions in the fight against infections. The functions of the human guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1) are tightly coupled to GTP hydrolysis and dimerization. Despite known crystal structures of the hGBP1 monomer and GTPase domain dimer, little is known about the dynamics of hGBP1. To gain a mechanistic understanding of hGBP1, we performed sub-millisecond multi-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both the hGBP1 monomer and dimer. We found that hGBP1 is a highly flexible protein that undergoes a hinge motion similar to the movements observed for other dynamin-like proteins. Another large-scale motion was observed for the C-terminal helix 13, providing a molecular view for the 13 13 distances previously reported for the hGBP1 dimer. The MD simulations were performed using GROMACS. The resulting trajectories along with the input files are provided. For the calculation of the Markov state models, PyEMMA was used; the Jupyter notebook that we developed in this context for the analysis of he hGBP1 motions is supplied.",
